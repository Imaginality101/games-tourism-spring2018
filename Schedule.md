## <a name="week1">Week 1</a> (Aug 29/31): Overview: Syllabus, Expectations, Tools
On Tuesday, I will review the syllabus, goals, and requirements for class, and discuss the tools and technologies we'll be using for communication, collaboration, and content creation. On Thursday, I'll talk about some general HTML and CSS concepts, and we'll start on an HTML & CSS exercise that builds on the content you should have covered in previous classes.
